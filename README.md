# University Ping
The [Future Studio blog](https://futurestud.io/blog) currently provides more than **223 tutorials** on topics like **Android** and **Node.js**.

Do you want us to write a specific tutorial? Let us know in the issues :) Just propose [an issue](https://github.com/fs-opensource/university-ping/issues/new) and fill in the missing parts within the prepared issue template :)

Please consider tutorial proposals for one of the following topics:

- Android: in general and any library that has a stable state without changing their API every week :)
- hapi
- RethinkDB
- Web performance

Thank you so much!
